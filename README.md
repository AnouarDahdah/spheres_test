# spheres_test
 The pipeline maps sphere parameters (center coordinates and radius) to their 3D SDF representation by predicting a latent space encoding using the LatentPredictor and reconstructing the SDF through the autoencoderâ€™s decoder. This allows efficient generation of SDFs directly from shape parameters.
